# My Oh-my-zsh theme

What does it do ?

Basically, exactly the same as everyone else's, but with a nice smiley face which get mad each time you do a mistake. 
༼づ｡◕‿‿◕｡༽づ --> ༼づ｡ಠ益ಠ｡༽づ

Nothing more ?

Nope.

# Install

Copy it in your $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/themes/, then set it in your .zshrc ZSH_THEME="blazux".

Enjoy !
